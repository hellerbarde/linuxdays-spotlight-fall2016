    - Java Build Tools 20min (Demo Nils, Theorie Phil)
      - Why are there multiple ones? 
        - Example Rust
      - Maven
      - Ant (Live Demo)
      - Gradle (Live Demo) - highlight differences to Ant
      - Concrete example how you could integrate that into all the tools we just presented (Maybe even a full live demo - setting up an
	empty git repo, start to edit a java project, set up a build file). I think this would be pretty nice to have, so people
        see the connection between all these tools in action.
